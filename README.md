# Module 4 : 4.16 - The lifecycle of an Effect

**Every React component goes through the same lifecycle:**

- A component mounts when itâ€™s added to the screen.
- A component updates when it receives new props or state, usually in response to an interaction.
- A component unmounts when itâ€™s removed from the screen.

> ðŸ”´ Itâ€™s a good way to think about components, but not about Effects.

> ðŸ“• Some Effects donâ€™t return a cleanup function at all. More often than not, youâ€™ll want to return oneâ€”but if you donâ€™t, React will behave as if you returned an empty cleanup function.
