# Module 4 : 4.17 - Effects react to reactive values

> Props and state arenâ€™t the only reactive values. Values that you calculate from them are also reactive. If the props or state change, your component will re-render, and the values calculated from them will also change. This is why all variables from the component body used by the Effect should be in the Effect dependency list.
